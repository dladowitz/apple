Q1 = OOP basics

a. Write a class called Foobar, that helps implements the following requirement

# For each number between 1 and 100, your code needs to print
# - “<number>: foo” if it’s divisible by 3 - e.g. “9: foo"
# - “<number>: bar” if it’s divisible by 5 - e.g. “10: bar"
# - “<number>: foobar” if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5 - e.g. “15: foobar"

b. Implement unit tests for Foobar to test above features, as well as some error cases. For example, what does the code do if input is non-numeric value?
