### Original Challenges 



Q1 = OOP basics

a. Write a class called Foobar, that helps implements the following requirement

 For each number between 1 and 100, your code needs to print
 - “number: foo” if it’s divisible by 3 - e.g. “9: foo"
 - “number: bar” if it’s divisible by 5 - e.g. “10: bar"
 - “number: foobar” if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5 - e.g. “15: foobar"

b. Implement unit tests for Foobar to test above features, as well as some error cases. For example, what does the code do if input is non-numeric value?


Q2 = JavaScript

Please design a browser application that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit and vice-versa.
Feel free to use your favorite javascript/css libraries. Please submit your source through github or any of the JS code playgrounds(https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/).


Q3 = System Automation

Given a log folder /var/logs...

Challenge A: find all .log files within /var/logs folder (including within nested subfolders etc)
Challenge B: output contents of every log file, using one shell liner
Challenge C: output lines containing timestamps of form 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

Q4 = Delivery

i. What does the term "deployability" mean to you?
ii. As a developer, what can you do to make your RoR applications "highly deployable”?
